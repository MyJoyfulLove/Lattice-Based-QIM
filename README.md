### Content-Aware Quantization Index Modulation

**Introduction** - QIM is a convenient and efficient data hiding paradigm. We propose a lattice-based CA-QIM method to reduce the distortion of this series of methods. The specific operation is to adaptively modify the lattice coset and the corresponding codebook by counting the correspondence between the carrier and the secret information.
